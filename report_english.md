# Music Genre Classification

## Introduction

### What is it exactly?

![](img/intro.png)

This project has a simple aim: determine the genre of a song based only on its audio characteristics (no metadata). This problem is a *classification* problem: for each song, we need to attribute a class (a genre).

The possible classes are: *blues, classical, country, disco, hip-hop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae* & *rock*.

### What has been done before

- Using this very dataset, a study was made on this [github repository](https://github.com/Insiyaa/Music-Tagging), achieving a 63% accuracy.

## Dataset & tools

### The data

The data is available on the *Kaggle* dataset [Music Features](https://www.kaggle.com/insiyeah/musicfeatures). It is composed of 1000 30-second audio tracks of 10 different genres, 100 tracks per genre. Each track is a 22050Hz Mono 16-bit audio file in .wav format. Several features are extracted from the songs using [libROSA](https://librosa.github.io/librosa/) library.
